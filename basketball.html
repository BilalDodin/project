            Tip-off Rules<br>
        <ol>
            <li>A coin toss or referee decision determines which team gets the first possession.</li>
            <li>The losing team starts the second half with possession of the ball.</li>
            <li>Teams switch sides at halftime, and the team that won the tip-off gets possession at the start of the third quarter.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Positioning: Anticipate your teammates' moves and take the right position on offense or defense.</li>
            <li>Defending: Focus on blocking shots, stealing the ball, and defending against passes.</li>
            <li>Dribbling: Maintain control of the ball while moving to create offensive opportunities.</li>
            <li>Shooting: Focus on accuracy, form, and timing to score points from various distances.</li>
            <li>Passing: Use different techniques like chest passes, bounce passes, and overhead passes for accuracy.</li>
            <li>Teamwork: Play with coordination, communication, and unselfishness to create scoring opportunities.</li>
        </ul><br><br>

            Key Rules<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traveling: Players must dribble the ball while moving. Taking too many steps without dribbling results in a violation.</li>
            <li>Double Dribble: A player cannot dribble, stop, and then resume dribbling. This is a violation.</li>
            <li>Fouls: Personal fouls are called for illegal physical contact with an opponent.</li>
            <li>Free Throws: Awarded for fouls during shooting attempts. Each free throw is worth one point.</li>
            <li>Three-Point Line: Shots made from beyond the three-point arc are worth three points.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p>Set Pieces<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Inbounds Pass: Performed to resume play after the ball has gone out of bounds.</li>
            <li>Free Throw: Awarded after certain fouls; the shooter gets a chance to score unopposed from the free-throw line.</li>
            <li>Jump Ball: Occurs at the start of the game or after a held ball situation, where two players battle for possession.</li>
            <li>Fast Break: A quick offensive transition to score before the defense sets up.</li>
            <li>Pick and Roll: A play where a player sets a screen (pick) and then moves toward the basket (roll) to receive a pass.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
