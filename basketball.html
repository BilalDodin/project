                    <ol>
                        <li>A coin toss or referee decision determines which team gets the first possession.</li>
                        <li>The losing team starts the second half with possession of the ball.</li>
                        <li>Teams switch sides at halftime, and the team that won the tip-off gets possession at the start of the third quarter.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Dribbling: Control the ball with both hands and change direction while moving quickly.</li>
                        <li>Shooting: Develop different types of shots, such as layups, jump shots, and three-pointers.</li>
                        <li>Passing: Master the chest pass, bounce pass, and overhead pass to move the ball effectively.</li>
                        <li>Defense: Focus on footwork, positioning, and timing to prevent the opposing team from scoring.</li>
                        <li>Rebounding: Get the ball after a missed shot by positioning yourself well and using your timing.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Traveling: Players must dribble the ball while moving. Taking too many steps without dribbling results in a violation.</li>
                        <li>Double Dribble: A player cannot dribble, stop, and then resume dribbling. This is a violation.</li>
                        <li>Fouls: Personal fouls are called for illegal physical contact with an opponent.</li>
                        <li>Free Throws: Awarded for fouls during shooting attempts. Each free throw is worth one point.</li>
                        <li>Three-Point Line: Shots made from beyond the three-point arc are worth three points.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 id="gold">Set Pieces:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Inbounds Pass:</strong> Performed to resume play after the ball has gone out of bounds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Free Throw:</strong> Awarded after certain fouls; the shooter gets a chance to score unopposed from the free-throw line.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jump Ball:</strong> Occurs at the start of the game or after a held ball situation, where two players battle for possession.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fast Break:</strong> A quick offensive transition to score before the defense sets up.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pick and Roll:</strong> A play where a player sets a screen (pick) and then moves toward the basket (roll) to receive a pass.</li>
